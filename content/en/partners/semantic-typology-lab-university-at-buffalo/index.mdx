Jürgen Bohnemeyer specializes in semantic typology, the crosslinguistic study of universals and variation in semantic categorization. An overarching theme in his research is the role of culture in cognition. He views this interest as part of a broader empiricist turn in the cognitive sciences. A closely related line of inquiry focuses on an evolutionary model of the typological distribution of functional expressions in the languages of the world.
