My research interests are the Balkan languages, and in the first place the Balkan convergence area from a synchronic as well as diachronic point of view, taking into account also the influence of the superstrate languages Turkish, Hungarian, German and Italian (for instance in the coastal region of Croatia). Another research focus is on the South Slavic dialect continuum and its isoglosses with special interest on the Torlak dialects of Serbia, as well as on Bulgarian and Macedonian. An other research interest of mine are the minority languages (especially in the Balkan region), their state of preservation, the influence of the standard languages and the language policy with respect to these minorities (e.g. the cases of Istria, Vojvodina, Transylvania or the Greek region of Macedonia).
