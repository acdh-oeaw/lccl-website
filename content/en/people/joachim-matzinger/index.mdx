My research focuses —among other interests— on the linguistic aspects of ethnogenetic and migratory processes in the time-span from the Indo-Europeanization of the Balkans to the ancient periods; the Paleo-Balkan languages (Illyrian, Thracian, and Messapian in ancient Italy); Balkan toponomastics and its implications for the settlement history; Balkan linguistics and especially linguistic contact phenomena; historical linguistics and philology of Old Albanian; history of writing in the Balkans; Albanian diaspora (Arbëresh) in Italy; etc.
