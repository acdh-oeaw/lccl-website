I investigate processes and triggers of language change and linguistic variation. On the one hand my research centers on Indo-European languages (in particular Slavic, Baltic, as well as Paleo-Balkan languages) and the reconstruction of the Indo-European proto-language, on the other hand on the interrelation of language, culture and cognition. A linguistic happening (a word, a grammatical or syntactic structure, their particular development, etc.) needs a cognitive demand appropriate in the given pragmatic (sociocultural) context. Therefore, all three dimensions are inseparable for the understanding of how it all works, how we come to put our thoughts into words and why these ways are different. Investigating semantic patterns across languages and cultures I seek to understand which are common and which divergent and how semantic variation is factored.
