I investigate the influence of natural change on the emergence of linguistic processes, e.g. how the language changes due to the construction of highways or anthropogenic landscapes, as for example in man-made course of rivers in the Balkans. Another research interest centers on ethnolinguistics of endonyms, exploring the names of local groups of people in the Balkan region, investigating their meaning, possible attributions and their morphological structures. In addition, I have a special interest in post-Yugoslav war literature.
