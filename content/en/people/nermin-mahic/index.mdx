My research centers on the linguistic Ottoman heritage in Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Ser-bian, but also on their history and the language politics of these languages. Furthermore, I have also a high interest in the processes of divergence of Serbo-Croatian and, accordingly, in both the historical encounters of the linguists of former Yugoslavia and the political framework in which the linguists did their work.
