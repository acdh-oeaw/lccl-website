summary: >-
  The cross-disciplinary seminar integrated as “conversatorium” of individual
  profile building into the MA curriculum is realized as joint-teaching. It aims
  to attract future junior researchers providing MA students with an opportunity
  to take an insider look at and collect first hands-on research experience in
  an interdisciplinary setting in research activities within the research
  network of LCCL and, in particular, at the Balkan Studies Research Unit of the
  Austrian Academy of Sciences. The focus lies on the holistic comprehension of
  regional studies and qualifications normally not covered by a standard
  curriculum. Beside basic knowledge in contact linguistics, regional history or
  anthropological methods students are supposed to acquire important working
  techniques while coping with multilayered “raw” material. Depending on
  personal research interests, students are encouraged to take part in current
  research activities within the LCCL network or Balkan Research Unit.
